Categories are like "tags" used to describe poems and collections.
Collections are more rigid when compared to categories: they have an order and tend not to change.
Collections are intended to be used for cataloging, assignments, etc.
In other words, collections are more "curated"
Categories are used to describe groups of similar poems. For example, a category could describe poems
that share a common theme, were written in the same time period, etc.
