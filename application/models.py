    It would be pretty cool to use an enum for additional validation, but Mongoengine sucks

    It would also be cool to use 'None' to for empty slots, but Mongoengine hates this as well,

    See https://github.com/MongoEngine/mongoengine/issues/1443
    Part of the philosophy is that 'None' should represent the absence of the field in MongoDB, which
    maps well to individual fields, but breaks in the context of lists. The idea of 'None' in a list
    is helpful, and it's a shame Mongoengine doesn't support it.
